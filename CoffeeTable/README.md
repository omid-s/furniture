# Side Tables

Side Tables are designed with a rough dimension of 22x22x22. 

## Reverse Cat
Reverse cat get the idea from me observing a friend's cat stretching on his back, though teh general idea of such design in not new by any means and there are tons of variations of it out there. This design complements the Reverse Cat coffee table (here)[https://github.com/omid-s/furniture/tree/main/CoffeeTable].
