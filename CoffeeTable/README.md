# Coffee Tables

Coffee table designs follow a 24x55 top size and a height of 17 inches.  Each design file contains multiple itterations of the design with varried components but generally maintaining the dimmentions.  

## Reverse Cat
Reverse cat get the idea from me observing a friend's cat stretching on his back, though teh general idea of such design in not new by any means and there are tons of variations of it out there.

We did endup building one variation of the reverse cat table with help from @parya-j in design, build and ofcourse she picked the color. Here are some snapshotps of the process and the finished design.

## Atlas 
Atlas gets the idea from a world (top) being held by the bottom (legs). Comes in variations of shelves and drawers. Atlas coffee table follows a (Fibonacci Sequence)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number] in sizes.
