# Side Tables

Side Tables are designed with a rough dimension of 22(h)x18(d)x70(w) to accomodate 75" TV with standard stands or smaller. most 75" TVs are about 65"s wide, the current 70" wide designs are more suitable for 65" TVs. 

## Reverse Cat
Reverse cat get the idea from me observing a friend's cat stretching on his back, though the general idea of such design in not new by any means and there are tons of variations of it out there. This design complements the Reverse Cat coffee table (here)[https://github.com/omid-s/furniture/tree/main/CoffeeTable].
